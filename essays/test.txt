Topic modeling is a type of Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that utilizes unsupervised learning methods to extract out the main topics of some text data we deal with. The word “Unsupervised” here means that there are no training data that have associated topic labels. Instead, the algorithms try to discover the underlying patterns, in this case, the topics, directly from the data itself.
There are various kinds of algorithms that are widely used for topic modelling. In my previous three articles, I introduced to you three algorithms for topic modeling: LDA, GSDMM, and NMF.
